  Struct representing a Discord guild member.

  ## User vs. Member
  A `user` contains only general information about that user such as a `username` and an `avatar`.
  A `member` has everything that a `user` has, but also additional information on a per guild basis. This includes things like a `nickname` and a list of `roles`.
